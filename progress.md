## Goal and Objective
The goal of building this simple web application is to gain practical exposure to the development workflow and surface-level familiarity with the modern web application framework ecosystem.  
In other words, the goal of this project is not mastery, but to develop foundational understanding of how each technology fits into a real-world application.  

## Progress
1. **Framework Research**  
    I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the modern web application development standards, and selected the tech stack as documented in `README.md`.  

    My research was carried out using:  
        - Official Documentation  
        - Github Repositories  
        - Stack Overflow Discussions  
        - Long-form technical tutorials  

    Below are the YouTube videos/playlists that I referred to:
        - [Next.js Tutorial for Beginners (Playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4ba60j_4o8&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhIEc4I4YsRz5C7GOBnxSJY)  
        - [Next.js Projects: Build a Full-stack App with Next.js, Tailwind, Radix UI, and Prisma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9sfR6HN6BY&list=PLkjUCItb_T_Y46gOYTXNKkuXogonkABq1)

        - [How to Use Supabase with Next.js – Full Setup Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGvBBDtRfo&list=PLkjUCItb_T_Y46gOYTXNKkuXogonkABq1&index=5)  
        - [How to Build Authentication with Supabase Auth + Next.js 16 (Full Step-by-Step Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sNri8TGGo)

        - [Supabase Full Course 2025 | Become a Supabase Pro in 1.5 Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyphLGnSz6Q)    

    These resources were used to understand:  
        1. Project structure and routing in Next.js  
        2. Authentication workflows  
        3. Database interaction using Supabase  
        4. Deployment considerations  
        
2. **System Design**  
    Before starting to code and develop the application, I made:  
        - a Context Diagram  
        - a Data Flow Diagram  

    These diagrams are used to:  
        - Identify system boundaries  
        - Visualize user interactions  
        - Understand data movement between the frontend, backend, authentication layer, and database  
        - Clarify the responsibilities of each technology in the stack  

    This design step was done to reduce implementation errors, improve clarity, and ensure the application architecture aligns with real-world development practices.  

3. **Development/Building the Application**
